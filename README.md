# NuMorph #

NuMoprh is a set of image analysis tools for quanityfing nuclei and classifying cell-types in tissue cleared whole brain images. 
While the functions in the current release were used to quantify cortical cell-types in our intial Top1 study, 
it has not been fully tested on other brain samples and not fully ready for general use. We are working diligently to integrate 
all the pieces of NuMorph and provide additional documentation. Check back soon for updates.
